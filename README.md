# Analysis-of-Epinions-Network
In this short project, we have analyzed the who-trust-whom online social network of a general
consumer review site Epinions. It was a website where people could review products. Users were
able to register for free and earn money according to how much their reviews were found useful.
Due to attempts to game the system and as a possible fix, a trust system was put in place. Users
were able to put people in their web of trust, where they would put people whose reviews were
consistently found useful, and their ”Blocklist”, i.e. ”authors whose reviews they find consistently
offensive, inaccurate, or in general not valuable”.
We have also performed the structural analysis, interpreted and described structural balance properties on epinions dataset
